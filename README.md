I don't keep any of the included apps on the calculator, as they just take up space. However, it is somewhat useful to have a periodic table to reference instead of having to look up an atomic weight or atomic number. So, I decided I would make one for the calculator that wouldn't take up much archive space. This is my current attempt at doing so. You can search by atomic number and symbol, as well as possibly name in the future (haven't gotten around to that yet). Otherwise, its pretty much complete, and contains the atomic number, symbol, and weight for all 118 elements known.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
